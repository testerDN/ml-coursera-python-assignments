You wrote a cost function and calculated its gradient, then took a gradient descent step accordingly. This time, instead of taking gradient descent steps, you will use the [`scipy.optimize` module](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html). SciPy is a numerical computing library for `python`. It provides an optimization module for root finding and minimization. As of `scipy 1.0`, the function `scipy.optimize.minimize` is the method to use for optimization problems(both constrained and unconstrained).\n\nFor logistic regression, you want to optimize the cost function $J(\\theta)$ with parameters $\\theta$.\nConcretely, you are going to use `optimize.minimize` to find the best parameters $\\theta$ for the logistic regression cost function, given a fixed dataset (of X and y values). You will pass to `optimize.minimize` the following inputs:\n- `costFunction`: A cost function that, when given the training set and a particular $\\theta$, computes the logistic regression cost and gradient with respect to $\\theta$ for the dataset (X, y). It is important to note that we only pass the name of the function without the parenthesis. This indicates that we are only providing a reference to this function, and not evaluating the result from this function.\n- `initial_theta`: The initial values of the parameters we are trying to optimize.\n- `(X, y)`: These are additional arguments to the cost function.\n- `jac`: Indication if the cost function returns the Jacobian (gradient) along with cost value. (True)\n- `method`: Optimization method/algorithm to use\n- `options`: Additional options which might be specific to the specific optimization method. In the following, we only tell the algorithm the maximum number of iterations before it terminates.\n\nIf you have completed the `costFunction` correctly, `optimize.minimize` will converge on the right optimization parameters and return the final values of the cost and $\\theta$ in a class object. Notice that by using `optimize.minimize`, you did not have to write any loops yourself, or set a learning rate like you did for gradient descent. This is all done by `optimize.minimize`: you only needed to provide a function calculating the cost and the gradient.\n\nIn the following, we already have code written to call `optimize.minimize` with the correct arguments.","metadata":{"cell_id":"879010ba-b59b-489a-85ac-4af21ab78257"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"e45e3de9-5842-4758-8867-5ade47496ee7"},"source":"# set options for optimize.minimize\noptions= {'maxiter': 400}\n\n# see documention for scipy's optimize.minimize  for description about\n# the different parameters\n# The function returns an object `OptimizeResult`\n# We use truncated Newton algorithm for optimization which is \n# equivalent to MATLAB's fminunc\n# See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18801002/fminunc-alternate-in-numpy\nres = optimize.minimize(costFunction,\n                        initial_theta,\n                        (X, y),\n                        jac=True,\n                        method='TNC',\n                        options=options)\n\n# the fun property of `OptimizeResult` object returns\n# the value of costFunction at optimized theta\ncost = res.fun\n\n# the optimized theta is in the x property\ntheta = res.x\n\n# Print theta to screen\nprint('Cost at theta found by optimize.minimize: {:.3f}'.format(cost))\nprint('Expected cost (approx): 0.203\\n');\n\nprint('theta:')\nprint('\\t[{:.3f}, {:.3f}, {:.3f}]'.format(*theta))\nprint('Expected theta (approx):\\n\\t[-25.161, 0.206, 0.201]')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Once `optimize.minimize` completes, we want to use the final value for $\\theta$ to visualize the decision boundary on the training data as shown in the figure below. \n\n![](Figures/decision_boundary1.png)\n\nTo do so, we have written a function `plotDecisionBoundary` for plotting the decision boundary on top of training data.

During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.\nSuppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.\n\nFirst, we load the data from a CSV file:","metadata":{"cell_id":"149c440c-8954-485f-b533-e354b2a75a0a"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"035702bf-073d-4a2a-b62e-56272a20ad5e"},"source":"# Load Data\n# The first two columns contains the X values and the third column\n# contains the label (y).\ndata = np.loadtxt(os.path.join('Data', 'ex2data2.txt'), delimiter=',')\nX = data[:, :2]\ny = data[:, 2]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.1 Visualize the data\n\nSimilar to the previous parts of this exercise, `plotData` is used to generate a figure, where the axes are the two test scores, and the positive (y = 1, accepted) and negative (y = 0, rejected) examples are shown with\ndifferent markers.","metadata":{"cell_id":"02c9f052-fe73-41a0-b9db-c8ec8314a002"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"876b1d26-b98d-4c14-90df-1040510b0c3b"},"source":"plotData(X, y)\n# Labels and Legend\npyplot.xlabel('Microchip Test 1')\npyplot.ylabel('Microchip Test 2')\n\n# Specified in plot order\npyplot.legend(['y = 1', 'y = 0'], loc='upper right')\npass","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above figure shows that our dataset cannot be separated into positive and negative examples by a straight-line through the plot. Therefore, a straight-forward application of logistic regression will not perform well on this dataset since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary.\n\n### 2.2 Feature mapping\n\nOne way to fit the data better is to create more features from each data point. In the function `mapFeature` defined in the file `utils.py`, we will map the features into all polynomial terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$ up to the sixth power.\n\n$$ \\text{mapFeature}(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & x_2 & x_1^2 & x_1 x_2 & x_2^2 & x_1^3 & \\dots & x_1 x_2^5 & x_2^6 \\end{bmatrix}^T $$\n\nAs a result of this mapping, our vector of two features (the scores on two QA tests) has been transformed into a 28-dimensional vector. A logistic regression classifier trained on this higher-dimension feature vector will have a more complex decision boundary and will appear nonlinear when drawn in our 2-dimensional plot.\nWhile the feature mapping allows us to build a more expressive classifier, it also more susceptible to overfitting. In the next parts of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to fit the data and also see for yourself how regularization can help combat the overfitting problem.\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"e7304edf-0b10-468d-9408-c4e653db7b17"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"c9605e2a-c44f-48c0-a978-d0b6f6d8b315"},"source":"# Note that mapFeature also adds a column of ones for us, so the intercept\n# term is handled\nX = utils.mapFeature(X[:, 0], X[:, 1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section5\"></a>\n### 2.3 Cost function and gradient\n\nNow you will implement code to compute the cost function and gradient for regularized logistic regression.
